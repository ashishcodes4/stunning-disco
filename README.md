# Stunning-Disco

A web based cross platform music playlist sharing application.

## Inspiration

Wanted to share a few cult classic rock songs from the good old 60's, but I am on platform X and my friend on platform Y. So tried serching if there is/are any application(s) to help with this... several google searches later I found few applications which would help me solve my problem.

While being different applications they all had one thing in common, they all wanted my money at some point or the other.

I don't judge people for what they do, but I couldn't look past this one, of all the sinful things this world is accused of, making money around sharing music and spreading love is just despicable.

Hence this application, a place to bring all your playlists, albums, favourites from all the major streaming platforms and have the ability to either replicate the same playlist on anyother platform for the same user or be able to share with different users.
