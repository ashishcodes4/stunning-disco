# Stunning-Disco

A web based cross platform music playlist sharing application.

## Inspiration

Wanted to share a few cult classic rock songs from the good old 60's, but I was using platform X and my friend platform Y. So tried serching if there is any application which could help with this problem.

While I found a couple of services that would help me get this task done, it all involved money and in my opinion of all the sinful things we have already done, we can't have monetisation around sharing music and spreading love.

Hence this application, a place to bring all your playlists, albums, favourites from all the major streaming platforms and have the ability to either replicate the same playlist on anyother platform for the same user or be able to share with different users.
